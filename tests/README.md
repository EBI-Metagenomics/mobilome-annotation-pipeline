# Test dataset

This test runs two independent samples for a positive and a negative tests.

The positive test consist of a compressed FASTA file containing eight contigs concatenaded from different sources having all types of mobile genetic elements that the pipeline is able to detect. In addition, the dataset includes a compressed GFF file with the proteins predicted by Prodigal v2.6.3 and the viral predictions generated by VIRify v3.0.0. 

The negative test consist of a compressed FASTA file containing two contigs with no mobile genetic elements.

The databases have been manually curated for testing purposes, aggressively trimmed down (with the exception of ICEfinder2 dbs for hmmer and MacsyFinder).
